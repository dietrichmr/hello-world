  Hello, this will hopefully serve as an adequate introduction to my foray into software engineering.

  At this point, I have no formal experience, and very scattered informal experience with programming. Most of my experience comes from learning TI Basic on my graphing calculator in middle school. It was rudimentary, but it helped me develop a firm grasp on the fundamentals.
  
  I'm somewhat familiar with the nature of algorithms, and how to collect the resources needed to accomplish my goals. My results are unsophisticated and inefficient, and I take some time to get there, but they more or less get the job done. I'd like to gather a more formal knowledge of programming, so that I can cut out the extra time and create more streamlined programs. Then I hope to use this experience and start my career in the programming field.
  
  In my research into entry-level programming, I've heard that Python is one of the best starting places, so I'll begin with documenting my path through that. It was recommended that I use the path provided at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ to learn the basics. To begin here, I'll document my progress through the example programs provided.
  
print('Hello, world!')
